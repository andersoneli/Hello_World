# Hello_World

Hello,

My name is Eli Anderson, I am an Entrepreneurial Management and Business Analytics/Information Systems double major at the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business. Outside of the classroom I enjoy hanging out with my friends and spending time outdoors, my favorite activities include hiking, biking, camping, and skiing.
